# Getting started

We currently follow the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model and are using [Hub Flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/TheHubFlowTools.html) extensions to assist with this. 


Install Hub Flow as follows
```
git clone https://github.com/datasift/gitflow
cd gitflow
sudo ./install.sh
```

Clone the repo you are working on, for example
```
git clone https://github.com/jac-uk/apply.git
```

Initialise hub flow
```
cd ##reponame##
git hf init
```
