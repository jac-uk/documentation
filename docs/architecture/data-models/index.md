# Data Models

We are looking to generate our data models documentation automatically from code. In the meantime any pertinent parts of the data models are included here, along with some of the patterns we follow:
- [Panels](panels.md)
- [Changes to enable support for old and new versions of Character Information section of the application form.](character-information.md)
