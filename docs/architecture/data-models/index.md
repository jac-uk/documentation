# Data Models

The following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVe74eHM9-fDXvSfrOCuItpK6VN2q63skELCVm3S_Eo/edit#gid=2019221856) is used to document our data models. However it goes out of date if not regularly updated :(

Instead we are looking to generate our data models documentation automatically from code.

In the meanwhile pertinent parts of our data models are included here, as well as some of the patterns we follow:
- [Panels](panels.md)
- [Support for old and new versions of Character Information section of the application form.](character-information.md)
