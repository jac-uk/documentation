# Architecture

We are loosely following the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com) for diagramming software architecture.

- Level 1: Context diagram - shows the high-level system and is suitable for anyone to gain an overview of the system
- Level 2: Container diagram for Digital Platform - shows a high-level view of the software 'containers' we are developing
- Level 3: Component diagram for Digital Platform - shows a more detailed view suitable for developers to gain an overview of the components we are developing
- Level 4: Code diagram - we do not currently have any code diagrams
