# Testing policy

The JAC platform has a suite of automated unit tests, which are integrated into a release pipeline and run every time the new work is merged into the 'main' branch.

When developers complete tickets, they create short videos to demonstrate how new/updated functionality should work and place them into a Google drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-kkQ1_ArvpIiHIid7NBPDzwnPoss0TPR). 

Links to the description of functionality and preview urls are posted to the 'user-testing' channel on Slack. BA and/or members of the User Testing Group review videos/[test scripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/142leRfwBIMZQbmZXivGzhcYrYTUfYUOS), test the functionality and post results into the Slack channel.
If there are issues, the developer would make necessary changes and ask the UTG to re-test. If no issues identified, the work is cleared for the release.
