# User Acceptance Testing

User Acceptance Testing sessions are run every wednesday afternoon, giving JAC staff an opportunity to test new features and hotfixes and help to find any bugs.

Testing takes place on the Develop environment so, prior to the session, data will be setup on the Develop environment to help facilitate the session.

- Feature description
- Sequence of steps to test the feature
- Videos/Screenshots showing the feature to help the user test it
- Preview URL on the Development environment (usually in the form of a specific link to a page where data has been setup to facilitate the testing of the feature)
